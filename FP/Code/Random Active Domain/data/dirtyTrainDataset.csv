The style of filming, consisting of long takes, with extended pauses and silences, the challenge of trying to create a comedy that depends on dialogue rather than on situations using an infinitely small event (waking up with a ringing sound in one's ears) in order to refer to infinitely greater themes, while always keeping a light touch, makes Ears a rather strange and oblique comedy, which is rather unusual within the Italian panorama of film production. For this reason the Biennale College - Cinema of the Venice Film Festival provided the perfect opportunity as the limitation of the super low budget offered creative freedom I needed. Every time I sat down to write scenes I imagined them in black and white, as if I could not see them in any other way, and as if there was a need to strain or filter the images in order to free them from colour, so that they could completely attain their most basic impact: that of the face, of the word, and of the whole scene.

She longs for adventure, sophistication, and opportunity, but finds none of that in her Sacramento Catholic high school. LADY BIRD follows the title character\'s senior year in high school, including her first romance, her participation in the school play, and most importantly, her applying for college.::Dehlia', ""Christine McPherson's senior year of high school in 2002/03 is presented, she the second of two offspring of Larry and Marion McPherson. Outwardly, she hates most aspects of her life. She hates that they have long lived a life of barely scraping by, their situation all the worse now as they as a collective are a victim of the poor economy. That economic reality has led to Larry recently being laid off, Marion needing to work double shifts as a counselor at a psychiatric hospital just to keep their head above water, and Christine's brother Miguel and his girlfriend Shelly moving back home in the McPhersons' small and already overcrowded house with one bathroom now for five people. She hates that what her parents have decided to spend on her within their already tight budget is an expensive Catholic private school education at Immaculate Heart, solely because Miguel witnessed long ago some violence outside Sacramento High, where she would have gone otherwise. At Immaculate Heart, she has only two friends, equally poor Julie Steffans, they playing upon their outsider status. She hates living in Sacramento, she who is determined to go to a liberal arts college back east, preferably New York City, using financial aid rather than go to a California college such as nearby UC-Davis for which she would eligible for an in-state reduction in tuition, that option already barely affordable. Whether she will even get into college is questionable as she has placed little effort into her school work despite being bright, except perhaps in math. But arguably what she hates the most is her strained relationship with her mother, Marion who is always bad cop to Larry's good cop in the parenting role. Marion and Christine's strained relationship is exacerbated by both being strong willed people. Christine believes that her mother may love her because she has to, but truly doesn't like her. In not wanting to take things from her mother out of a natural course of family, Christine has decided to rename herself Lady Bird, something she wants everyone to call her from now on. As Lady Bird goes through some major events her senior year - from discovering a new school extracurricular activity which includes boys from neighboring St. Francis Xavier, to testing the waters of dating, possible first love and the prospect of sex, to wanting to be part of the in-crowd, to truly placing some effort into her short term post-secondary dreams - she and Marion may only have a short period of time to express their true love for each other, family or not, before it's too late.::Huggo"", 'Going by the name of ""Lady Bird"", the outspoken Catholic high school senior student, Christine McPherson, is dreaming big of finally leaving her hometown of Sacramento, practically on pins and needles to attend a sophisticated New York City college. However, with her average grades and her family struggling to keep afloat, attending a public university closer to home would be a lot cheaper and safer, especially after last year\'s devastating 9/11 attack. In the end, amid grades, numerous college applications, a blooming teenage sexuality, and a strong-willed mother who is a real mother hen, Lady Bird must find a way to make her dreams happen. Can she survive life\'s bumps and cracks?::Nick Riganas', 'Sacramento, 2002. Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson is in her final year of high school.

The style of filming, consisting of long takes, with extended pauses and silences, the challenge of trying to create a comedy that depends on dialogue rather than on situations using an infinitely small event (waking up with a ringing sound in one's ears) in order to refer to infinitely greater themes, while always keeping a light touch, makes Ears a rather strange and oblique comedy, which is rather unusual within the Italian panorama of film production. For this reason the Biennale College - Cinema of the Venice Film Festival provided the perfect opportunity as the limitation of the super low budget offered creative freedom I needed. Every time I sat down to write scenes I imagined them in black and white, as if I could not see them in any other way, and as if there was a need to strain or filter the images in order to free them from colour, so that they could completely attain their most basic impact: that of the face, of the word, and of the whole scene.
