The style of filming, consisting of long takes, with extended pauses and silences, the challenge of trying to create a comedy that depends on dialogue rather than on situations using an infinitely small event (waking up with a ringing sound in one's ears) in order to refer to infinitely greater themes, while always keeping a light touch, makes Ears a rather strange and oblique comedy, which is rather unusual within the Italian panorama of film production. For this reason the Biennale College - Cinema of the Venice Film Festival provided the perfect opportunity as the limitation of the super low budget offered creative freedom I needed. Every time I sat down to write scenes I imagined them in black and white, as if I could not see them in any other way, and as if there was a need to strain or filter the images in order to free them from colour, so that they could completely attain their most basic impact: that of the face, of the word, and of the whole scene.

Over the years, some of the citizens managed to erect a new city in a corner of the Lost Ground and surrounded it with a barrier to protect it from the impoverished inhabitants of the island\\'s surrounding wasteland. However, another phenomenon began to show up in the Lost Ground: Alter, the ability to rearrange matter at the atomic level in certain ways. \"Inners\" who were born with Alter powers became known as Alter Users, and Alter Users who lived outside the city and misused their powers were branded \"Natives\". The police force known as HOLD was constructed to control Native Alter Users. A division of it called HOLY was later created and made up almost entirely of law-abiding Alter Users. Now, however, HOLD and HOLY\\'s control over the Lost Ground has become increasingly oppressive to the point that it has started to enslave the wasteland\\'s people. Enter Kazuma, a reckless and hotheaded Native who lives with a little girl named Kanami. Kazuma barely manages to survive off working on a farm and doing tasks for his friend Kimishima.

The style of filming, consisting of long takes, with extended pauses and silences, the challenge of trying to create a comedy that depends on dialogue rather than on situations using an infinitely small event (waking up with a ringing sound in one's ears) in order to refer to infinitely greater themes, while always keeping a light touch, makes Ears a rather strange and oblique comedy, which is rather unusual within the Italian panorama of film production. For this reason the Biennale College - Cinema of the Venice Film Festival provided the perfect opportunity as the limitation of the super low budget offered creative freedom I needed. Every time I sat down to write scenes I imagined them in black and white, as if I could not see them in any other way, and as if there was a need to strain or filter the images in order to free them from colour, so that they could completely attain their most basic impact: that of the face, of the word, and of the whole scene.
