The style of filming, consisting of long takes, with extended pauses and silences, the challenge of trying to create a comedy that depends on dialogue rather than on situations using an infinitely small event (waking up with a ringing sound in one's ears) in order to refer to infinitely greater themes, while always keeping a light touch, makes Ears a rather strange and oblique comedy, which is rather unusual within the Italian panorama of film production. For this reason the Biennale College - Cinema of the Venice Film Festival provided the perfect opportunity as the limitation of the super low budget offered creative freedom I needed. Every time I sat down to write scenes I imagined them in black and white, as if I could not see them in any other way, and as if there was a need to strain or filter the images in order to free them from colour, so that they could completely attain their most basic impact: that of the face, of the word, and of the whole scene.
