The Yamatai army, led by Sarutahaiko, destroys the entire village, but Guzuri, who is initially blamed, and Hinaku escape, and Nagi, the son of the chief, is spared because he knows where the phoenix lives. Initially enraged, Hinaku eventually makes Sarutahaiko take charge of Nagi, who trains him to fight animated foxes, but he is thrown in a pit of wasps when Nagi teams up with Oro, daughter of the innocent man who was executed, in attempt to kill the queen, though Nagi hits a servant, instead.

Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of \"as you wish\" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her.

The style of filming, consisting of long takes, with extended pauses and silences, the challenge of trying to create a comedy that depends on dialogue rather than on situations using an infinitely small event (waking up with a ringing sound in one's ears) in order to refer to infinitely greater themes, while always keeping a light touch, makes Ears a rather strange and oblique comedy, which is rather unusual within the Italian panorama of film production. For this reason the Biennale College - Cinema of the Venice Film Festival provided the perfect opportunity as the limitation of the super low budget offered creative freedom I needed. Every time I sat down to write scenes I imagined them in black and white, as if I could not see them in any other way, and as if there was a need to strain or filter the images in order to free them from colour, so that they could completely attain their most basic impact: that of the face, of the word, and of the whole scene.
