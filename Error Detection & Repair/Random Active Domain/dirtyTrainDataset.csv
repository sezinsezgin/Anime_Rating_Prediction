To succeed, she does not hesitate to take bold steps.

She is straightforward about the facts. She worked as a London based model, her most famous job being as the Honeyglow girl, and had a moderately successful stint as an actress in small roles both on film and in commercials. She married her first husband Tony Bridges when they were both quite young, but she left him when she fell into an unplanned relationship with television journalist Robert Gold, who was at the time married himself with a family. Although she and Robert never married, they lived together for some time. She and Robert split after she fell into an unplanned relationship with advertising executive Miles Brand, who was the one who discovered her as the Honeyglow girl. She met her current husband, the Prince Cesare della Romita while she was working and vacationing in Italy. But behind these facts, she is less than forthright about her emotions in each of these moves, and the motivations for them. If she was forthright, she would expose herself as the vain and self-centered person she is, who was most understood by Miles, but who Robert began to understand, albeit too late.::Huggo', 'Beautiful but easily bored Diana Scott becomes a popular model and actress in London in the 1960s while toying with the affections of two older men, married television newsman Robert Gold and public relations mastermind Miles Brand.

Outwardly, she hates most aspects of her life. She hates that they have long lived a life of barely scraping by, their situation all the worse now as they as a collective are a victim of the poor economy. That economic reality has led to Larry recently being laid off, Marion needing to work double shifts as a counselor at a psychiatric hospital just to keep their head above water, and Christine's brother Miguel and his girlfriend Shelly moving back home in the McPhersons' small and already overcrowded house with one bathroom now for five people. She hates that what her parents have decided to spend on her within their already tight budget is an expensive Catholic private school education at Immaculate Heart, solely because Miguel witnessed long ago some violence outside Sacramento High, where she would have gone otherwise. At Immaculate Heart, she has only two friends, equally poor Julie Steffans, they playing upon their outsider status. She hates living in Sacramento, she who is determined to go to a liberal arts college back east, preferably New York City, using financial aid rather than go to a California college such as nearby UC-Davis for which she would eligible for an in-state reduction in tuition, that option already barely affordable. Whether she will even get into college is questionable as she has placed little effort into her school work despite being bright, except perhaps in math. But arguably what she hates the most is her strained relationship with her mother, Marion who is always bad cop to Larry's good cop in the parenting role. Marion and Christine's strained relationship is exacerbated by both being strong willed people. Christine believes that her mother may love her because she has to, but truly doesn't like her. In not wanting to take things from her mother out of a natural course of family, Christine has decided to rename herself Lady Bird, something she wants everyone to call her from now on.

However, a bandit named OniGumo who is obsessed with Kikyo offers his body to a group of demons who inhabit it and he ceases to exist and becomes a half-demon called Naraku, who, above everything else, desires power. Naraku disguises himself as InuYasha and attacks and fatally wounds Kikyo, who then, believing her attacker was her former lover, shoots InuYasha thru the heart with a sacred arrow that puts him sleep forever or until the curse is lifted. Kikyo dies and the jewel is burned with her. However, fast-forward several hundred years into the future and we meet Kagome, a girl who lives in Tokyo at a shrine with her family. Not knowing she is the reincarnation of the priestess Kikyo she goes down one day into her family's well and then is transported thru a mystical portal to the feudal-era of Japan's history. There she meets InuYasha and frees him from his tree when the village is attacked by a demon. Having the jewel hidden inside her body, Kagome soon has it taken out and it is not long before a demon steals it and she shoots the jewel with an arrow and it shatters into thousands of peaces. Over the course of the series, InuYasha, Kagome, and the friends they come to meet battle Naraku in a race to rebuild the jewel before Naraku can use it for his own evil purposes.

The grandson is sure he won\'t like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and ""no kissing"". But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn\'t want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of ""as you wish"" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.::Huggo', ""A kindly grandfather sits down with his ill grandson and reads him a story.

Heartbroken, Buttercup has sworn never to love again, but accepts the marriage proposal of the rich and handsome Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin; but death is no barrier to true love, and in a story filled with exotically-accented swordsmen, big-hearted giants, genius kidnappers, sadistic torturers, vile swamps, Rodents of Unusual Size, the Dread Pirate Roberts and a somewhat embittered miracle worker, the love between Westley and Buttercup twists and turns on a path filled with adventure.

The style of filming, consisting of long takes, with extended pauses and silences, the challenge of trying to create a comedy that depends on dialogue rather than on situations using an infinitely small event (waking up with a ringing sound in one's ears) in order to refer to infinitely greater themes, while always keeping a light touch, makes Ears a rather strange and oblique comedy, which is rather unusual within the Italian panorama of film production. For this reason the Biennale College - Cinema of the Venice Film Festival provided the perfect opportunity as the limitation of the super low budget offered creative freedom I needed. Every time I sat down to write scenes I imagined them in black and white, as if I could not see them in any other way, and as if there was a need to strain or filter the images in order to free them from colour, so that they could completely attain their most basic impact: that of the face, of the word, and of the whole scene.
